<p>As some of you may already know, I've begun work on a series of NHibernate tutorials as the first steps in a larger effort to help update the NHibernate reference documentation.</p>
<p>For many users, starting out with NHibernate is less of a learning curve and more of a learning cliff - so the intent with this first article series is to gradually expose the user to the features of NHibernate, from basic mapping through advanced techniques.</p>
<p>A couple of themes I am working to maintain through the tutorial series include not throwing too many new concepts in at once, and to keep the focus on the <em>ORM</em> side of the application and not get lost in the details of user interface implementation (although I plan on doing an MVC example in a later tutorial).&nbsp; Another key part is that through the initial series of tutorials, I'll be building on a common frame of reference that can be used to better illustrate examples as&nbsp;I move from the tutorial portion and onto the FAQ/How-To and reference sections.</p>
<p>My current plan is to publish a new segment each week for review, so any feedback or technical corrections are greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>You can find the first three tutorials at these links:</p>
