<p>NHibernate.Burrow is a light weight middleware developed to support
.Net applications using NHibernate (maybe also referred as NH in this
article) as ORM framework by providing advanced and smart
session/transaction management and other facilitates. Documentation and
examples are available at NHForge.net. Any feedback or issue can be
sent to NHibernate user group(<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nhusers" target="_new">http://groups.google.com/group/nhusers</a>)
or jira.nhibernate.org and will be greatly appreciated. 1.0.0 GA
consists of no major bug fixes from 1.0.0 CR2. However it introduced a
breaking naming change in the configuration file - the section
&lt;persistantUnits&gt; is now renamed to &lt;persistenceUnits&gt;.</p>
